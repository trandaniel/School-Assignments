When working in groups, designate ONE member as the "Submit-Person".

SUBMIT-PERSON SUBMITS:
---------------------

  A1.c           (see assign1.txt)
  A1cert.txt     (see below for content)
  A1member.txt   (see below for content)

EACH OTHER GROUP MEMBER SUBMITS only her/his own:
-----------------------------------------------

  A1member.txt   (see below for content)


A1member.txt
------------
-contains the following lines: 
     your name, 
     your CS userid, 
     your section,
     your student ID number, 
     your TA(s), 
     your lab day/time
     Name and CS userid of your group's Submit Person
     Name and CS userid of each remaining group member
     

A1cert.txt
----------
Must contain exactly ONE OF the following 3 lines: 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. I certify this assign is entirely my group's own work.
  2. I certify this assign is entirely my group's own work, but we received minor assistance 
     from other students.
  3. I certify this assign is entirely my group's own work, but we received considerable 
     assistance from X 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  -It is OK to get help from others, as long as they help you do your own work. 
  -There is no problem if you put the second one above on your work. In fact, I expect it.
  -X should be the name of whomever assisted you, or a resource such as a website.  
   Doing your own work is important, but being honest about the origin of the work is an 
   essential part of professional integrity.

How to get zero on the assignment:
---------------------------------
  -one or more members forget or have incorrect A1member.txt file(s), and/or
  -a non-Submit-Person also submits file(s) OTHER than A1member.txt
  -any files are named wrong (wrong case, missing .txt, etc.)
