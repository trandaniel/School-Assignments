Q: 
  The given code for assignment 3 isn't really well commented.
  Do you know what the "LessKeys" case means?
A:
  Figuring out what the code is doing (and is trying to do) is 
  part of the assignment.

Q:
  With regards to question #3 from assignment 3. The description says 
  that the function prints the total number of keys in the tree. 
  Is it acceptable if I make the function return an integer and use
  "printf" to print the number of keys instead, or do I have to print 
  the number of keys directly from within the function.
A:
  Your function must print the total number of keys. However, the
  function could (should?) use a helper-function which returns the 
  appropriate integer.

Q:
  Can we have two separate methods for the Max and Min question for
  Assignment 3? Or do we have to have them both in the same method?
A:
  Either way. Two is fine.

Q:
  Do we need still to provide header comments on the functions
  that were already been given to us? Also, do we have to explain everything
  that is happening inside those functions?
A:
  No. Just explain your modifications, if complicated.
