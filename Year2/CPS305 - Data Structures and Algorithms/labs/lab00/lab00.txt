Lab00 
-----
Your programs must always verify requests for storage were successful.
If malloc returns NULL, print an error message and terminate the program.

1. Write a program named lab00.c that creates a struct to hold a node
   with fields Airport and Link, as shown in the diagram near the bottom
   of page 37. The program should then create variables L and N, and 
   set up the complete diagram as shown near the bottom of page 37.
2. By hand, complete Exercise 2 on page 38, and then verify your answers
   as follows:
   Modify your code from question 1 above so that it verifies your answers  
   to Exercise 2 using printf statements. For example, to verify 
     (i) a pointer to the node containing MIA
   you write code to follow your pointer expression and print MIA from
   the pointer's Airport field.
3. Submit your lab00.c using the submit program, as in:
   submit-cps305dwoit lab00.c
4. Check that the file was received by running the program:
   check-submit-cps305dwoit 

5. If you have finished the above, continue to work on the remaining exercises 
   in Section 2.4. Once you finish them, write programs to check your answers.
   If you finish that, then modify all your programs to use function AddNode
   to create the list, and function PrintList to print the Airport codes in a 
   list.
