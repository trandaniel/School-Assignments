Lab 06
-------

For Fall 2014: 
    DO NOT ATTEND LABS this week (Nov 3 and Nov 5). 
    This Lab06 will be due next week (Nov 10 and 12).


The template for your lab06answers.txt file is given in this directory.
Copy it into your filespace, and complete it by replacing "XXXX" with
the appropriate text.


For all questions:
  -Once the insertion/deletion is complete, do a level-order traversal 
   of the resulting tree, putting a dot between keys like in lab06prep.txt.
  -DO NOT put any spaces in your traversal
  -Enter your level-order traversal into the appropriate place in file
   lab06answers.txt  (replace appropriate "XXXX")
   Each line in lab06answers.txt must have the correct FORMAT, or it 
   will be considered incorrect.  The format is: 
   question number (i.e., Q1) followed by colon followed by the traversal followed by a newline
   Note that question Q1 was already completed for you.
   Note that there are no spaces in the answer lines.

Q1:
  Note: This question was already answered for you in lab06answers.txt
        so that you can double-check the format of your answer.
  Do an level-order traversal of the 2-3 tree (B-Tree order 3) in:
  http://www.scs.ryerson.ca/~dwoit/courses/cps305/coursedirPublic305/NOTES/trees/BTree1.jpg
  Type the level-order traversal into lab06answers.txt using the FORMAT 
  shown above. 


Q2:
  Insert 95 into the 2-3 tree (B-Tree order 3) in:
  http://www.scs.ryerson.ca/~dwoit/courses/cps305/coursedirPublic305/NOTES/trees/BTree1.jpg
  Use "rotation with sibling" WHEN POSSIBLE; otherwise use node splitting (push up to parent). 
  THEN, insert 93 into the resulting B-tree.
  Use "rotation with sibling" WHEN POSSIBLE; otherwise use node splitting (push up to parent). 
  After the insertions, type the level-order traversal of the final tree into
  lab06answers.txt using the FORMAT shown above (replacing the "XXXX" on line 2).


Q3: 
  Delete 70 from the ORIGINAL 2-3 tree (B-Tree order 3) in:
  http://www.scs.ryerson.ca/~dwoit/courses/cps305/coursedirPublic305/NOTES/trees/BTree1.jpg
  Do the deletion using the method described in class--but you must use the inorder PREDECESSOR
  as the replacement key.
  After the deletion, type the level-order traversal of the resulting tree into
  lab06answers.txt using the FORMAT shown above (replacing the "XXXX" on line 3).

Q4: 
  Delete 70 from the ORIGINAL 2-3 tree (B-Tree order 3) in:
  http://www.scs.ryerson.ca/~dwoit/courses/cps305/coursedirPublic305/NOTES/trees/BTree1.jpg
  Do the deletion using the method described in class--but you must use the inorder SUCCESSOR
  as the replacement key.
  After the deletion, type the level-order traversal of the resulting tree into
  lab06answers.txt using the FORMAT shown above (replacing the "XXXX" on line 4).
