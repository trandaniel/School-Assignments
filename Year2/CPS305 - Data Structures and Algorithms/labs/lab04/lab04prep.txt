Lab 04 - preparation
----------

Directory code_from_text/ contains the following files from Section 7.8 of your text:

   QueueImplementation.c
   QueueTypes.h
   QueueInterface.h

Minor changes were made to these files, such as:
   -definition of SystemError function
   -return codes for Insert and Remove
   -the Queue holds integer items

A simple driver program is in file:  SimpleQueueDriver.c
Use separate compilation to create QueueImplementation.o and SimpleQueueDriver.o
Compile the *.o files into an executable called SimpleQueueDriver
Execute your SimpleQueueDriver to make sure it works!

Create a driver program named QueueDriver.c to more thoroughly test the Queue 
implementation.  (Do not alter the given Queue*.[ch] files. You must get your 
driver to use the Q implementation via appropriate #include line(s) and compilation).
Your driver should: 
   a) create and initialize a Q 
   b) insert some items into the Q
   c) remove some items from the Q

QueueDriver.c should check :
   a) return codes of insert and remove (print message if fail)
   b) remove gets the item you expect from the Q
   c) the empty function returns true when the Q is supposed to be empty, and
      false when the Q is supposed to contain items


Use separate compilation to create QueueImplementation.o and QueueDriver.o
Compile Queue*.o into an executable called QueueDriver
Execute your QueueDriver to make sure it works!
