1. Consider the tree in file XXXX

   a. Give a Level Order Traversal of the tree.
   b. Give a Pre-Order Traversal of the tree.
   c. Give a In-Order Traversal of the tree.
   d. Give a Post-Order Traversal of the tree.

2. Consider the expression tree in file YYYY:
   What is the final result of evaluating the expression denoted by this tree?
   (Give the final integer value).
                                                                 
3. Consider the BST in file XXXX:
   Insert 18 into the tree. 
   What node is 18's parent? is 18 the right- or left-child of its parent?

4. Consider the BST in file XXXX:
   Insert 21 into the ORIGINAL tree. 
   What node is 21's parent? is 21 the right- or left-child of its parent?

5. Consider the BST in file XXXX:
   If your tree has a 19 in it:
   If 19 were deleted from the ORIGINAL tree, what is 17's new right-child?
   If your tree has a 20 in it:
   If 20 were deleted from the ORIGINAL tree, what is the new root?

6. Consider the BST in file XXXX:
   If your tree has a 17 in it:
   If 17 were deleted from the ORIGINAL tree, what are the 2 candidate nodes to replace it?
   If your tree has a 20 in it:
   If 8 were deleted from the ORIGINAL tree, what are the 2 candidate nodes to replace it?

7. Look at the BST implementation and driver in /usr/courses/cps305/programs/BST/
   Copy the code into your own filespace and modify BSTDriver.c so that it does some
   successful and unsuccessful searches. 
   For each search, BSTDriver must determine if the search was successful or unsuccessful 
   by examining Search's return value.
    -For a successful search, print out the actual "found" entry from the returned TreeNode
     to double-check Search worked properly. 
    -For each unsuccessful search, print out an appropriate message.
   Note that this question (7) is not submitted.

8. Type your answers from 1-6 above into a file named lab05Answers.txt
   If an answer is not CLEARLY NUMBERED, it is worth zero marks.

9. Submit lab05Answers.txt
