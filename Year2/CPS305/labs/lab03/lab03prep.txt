Consider the code in findTest.c
The find function looks for an item in the array A, from A[0] to
A[max_index] inclusive. If the item is not found, -1 is returned.
If the item is found, the item's index in A is returned.

1. 
  Look at the code in findTest.c and understand it.
  Compile and run it. Try changing main by using different values
  and sizes for A, and searching for different items.
  
2.
  Consider the case in which the item is NOT FOUND in A.
  Let the problem size, n, be: 
      the NUMBER of elements of A that are COMPARED to item.
  For example, for find(i,A,8) n=9 (9 elements are considered: A[0],A[1],...A[9])
               for find(i,A,4) n=5 (5 elements are considered: A[0],A[1],...A[4])

  Consider the recurrence relation for S(n), the space used when the item
  is NOT FOUND.  The base case is S(0). Why do we use 0?
  Write the complete base case, and the recursive case for the recurrence relation.
