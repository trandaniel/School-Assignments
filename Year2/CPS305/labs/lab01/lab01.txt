Lab01 
------

0. Your TA will tell you what XXXX is for your particular lab. 
   Possibilities for XXXX include, but are not limited to:
   GOING-UP 
   GOING-DOWN
   EDGES-AND-CENTER
   DIVISION-IN-HALVES

1. In a file named Prod.c, write a XXXX RECURSIVE function 
   Prod(int x, int y) that 
   computes the product of the numbers from x to y inclusive. 
   e.g., Prod(8,8) returns 8; Prod(10,11) returns 110; Prod(2,5) returns 120

   Your function may assume: 
     x and y are both positive integers, and
     x<=y 

   Make sure your function compiles correctly.

2. Insert the following line at the top of Prod.c, with XXXX 
   replaced appropriately:
   /* This function uses XXXX recursion */

3. Write a file Prod.h necessary to use your function

4. Write a main program called ProdTest.c that tests your function.
   Make sure you test at least:
     ALL your base cases, 
     any "special" cases you might have, 
     your recursive case.
   For base cases and special cases, your test must call Prod with
   arguments that cause the case to occur on the FIRST call.

5. Submit your files: ProdTest.c, Prod.c, and Prod.h 
   Note:
     Submit with:
        submit-cps305dwoit <filenames>
     Check submit directory with:
        check-submit-cps305dwoit

6. If you complete you lab, write programs to answer questions from 
   Section 3.2 of the text. These questions are available in this
   directory as file: standish_recursion_exercises.pdf
   or on the class notes page at:
   http://www.scs.ryerson.ca/~dwoit/courses/cps305/coursedirPublic305/NOTES/standish_recursion_exercises.pdf
