CPS305 Lab09 
------------

For Fall 2014: 
    Lab09 is submitted in your regular lab time (Nov 24 and 26). 


0. Copy lab09answers.txt into your own filespace.
   You will modify it by replacing "XXXX" (see below.)

1. The following programs are given in this directory:
      OpenAddrHash.c   - implementation of hashing ADT
      OpenAddrHash.h   - header for hashing ADT
      lab09L.c         - a main program that uses a hash table
 
   Compile these into executable lab09L and run it. Understand what it does.
  
2. Copy lab09L.c to lab09D.c
   Change lab09D.c so that it uses double hashing instead of the linear probe.
   Use the quotient function (integer division) for p(K). 
   Compile into executable lab09D and run it. 

3. A collision happens when a key hashes into a slot that is ALREADY full. 
   Figure out the number of number of collisions that happen when INSERTING
   items into the hash tables in lab09L and lab09D.
   You might find a 17-Times-Table useful. One is in: 17TimesTable.txt

   (L) How many insertion collisions occurred in lab09L (linear probe)? 
   (D) How many insertion collisions occurred in lab09D (double hashing)? 
   (A) What is the load factor of the hash tables in percent?  Truncate your 
       percentage to a whole number. E.g., if the load factor were .658117 
       then your answer is 65

4. Enter answers for (L), (D), and (A) above into lab09answers.txt, 
   replacing the appropriate "XXXX" (no spaces!).

5. Double-check your answers by modifying any code you need to (if you have
   not already done so). Note: no code is to be submitted.

6. Submit lab09answers.txt using the usual submit program
